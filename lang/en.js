// Why Page
const _why_title = "Why Did We Developed This Curriculum?";
const _why_content = "<p>Let's start with clarifying what different industries mean when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI). As a branch of science, artificial intelligence tries to imitate the human way of thinking. For this, it acquires the techniques used in computer science. But now we are quite far from machines that think and act like people. When we say that there is artificial intelligence in a product at the moment, we are referring to machine learning which is a sub-branch of artificial intelligence. For example, an AI-powered home thermostate system creates a learning algorithm in itself by matching the average temperature of the house and the movements of people with each other on an hourly basis.</p>\n" +
    "<p>For example, in thermostates, cars, toys, and in many more products different techniques are used for the development of artificial intelligence. As soon as we were born, we started to meet with these products. Our aim in developing this artificial intelligence curriculum is to get students familiar with the answers to questions like how these devices work, what techniques underlie them, how to make it possible to develop these technologies for goodness and humanity.</p>\n" +
    "<p>This curriculum consists of three modules and a term project.</p>\n" +
    "<h3>How do Intelligent Interfaces Work?</h3>\n" +
    "<p>How can interfaces that students already see on the screen be more intelligent? For example, how does the keyboard application on our mobile phones offer us suggestions? Are the results that Youtube suggests to us ethically? What should we consider if we want to design an interface? How does the process of designing an artificial intelligence-supported product take place?</p>\n" +
    "<h3>How do Computers See?</h3>\n" +
    "<p>If artificial intelligence is trying to imitate the human, we must first understand our own eyes. How do our eyes see? What is the similarity between the sensors and our eyes? How do computers perceive physical changes and how do they represent numerically? How do we use these numerical values in algorithms? What is the data set? What do we do with collecting datasets? What are the ethical discussions in computer vision?</p>\n" +
    "<h3>How do Computers Hear?</h3>\n" +
    "<p>How does the human ear work? What are the similarities between a microphone and our ear? How can we classify human voices? How can we promote the human language to computers? Can computers make music?</p>\n" +
    "<h3>Term Project: AI for Good</h3>\n" +
    "<p>Students complete many activities on the theory and practice of artificial intelligence and technology through the curriculum. To observe the efficiency of these activities, they develop solutions for one of the United Nations Sustainability Goals with AI.</p>\n" +
    "<p>After all modules, you may have noticed that the modules are following a loop:</p>\n" +
    "<ol>\n" +
    "<li>Computers use sensors to detect physical environments.</li>\n" +
    "<li>Physical changes, with the help of sensors, turn into numerical values that can be used in the algorithm.</li>\n" +
    "<li>Learning algorithms learn with the help of different data sets.</li>\n" +
    "<li>Various modalities are required for the interaction of artificial intelligence and human.</li>\n" +
    "<li>Artificial intelligence can have good and bad consequences for humanity, so ethical issues should be discussed.\n" +

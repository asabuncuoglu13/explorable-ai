# AI Curriculum for Middle School

This repository holds the up-to-date interactive web content for our AI curriculum. The curriculum is developed at Twin Science and Robotics with the collaboration of Koc and ENKA Schools. We presented the design process of the curriculum at the ACM ITICSE conference, which you can read from here.

We integrated several open-source projects into our curriculum and copied the following projects into our repository to customize and translate:

1. [JOY.js](https://ncase.me/joy/) Programming: This simple and interactive programming interface allows novices to grasp the basic structures in the coding such as if-then-else statements, for loops, assignment operation, and so on. The curriculum is developed to teach the powerful ideas behind AI, we do not intend to teach AI-programming. Starting with Turtle programming before the computer vision module prepared students to understand iterative and recursive methods in the AI-algorithms. The second module (speech recognition) also starts with Joy's Music Programmer to introduce simple music terminology with an intuition of programming.

2. [The Eye](https://idyll.pub/post/the-eye-5b169094cce3bece5d95e964/): is the first interactive content of the curriculum. It is important to teach the key differences between human and machine if we want to replicate the functionality of human into a machine. Our computer vision part starts with introducing eye. We copied the content in this repo with the Turkish translation.

3. [Edge Detection Algorithms](https://cse442-17f.github.io/Sobel-Laplacian-and-Canny-Edge-Detection-Algorithms/): Edge Detection is a key feature to recognize an image. Understanding the math behind the edge detection help students to open the black-box definition of AI. 

4. [FFT Spectrogram](https://therewasaguy.github.io/p5-music-viz/demos/04b_fft_spectrograph/): The science and art behind the speech recognition are incredible. Computers can process 44.000 samples in one second and precisely recognize if you say "Spectrogram" or "Fourier Transform"! This is only possible with a technique called a spectrogram. 

## Notes on Contribution
It is an active project, we are actively updating our resources and would like to see any feedback and ideas on developing new paths for the project. 

We are collaborating with marvellous high schools students to check the content and translate the resources.

- Berke Yılmaz, Deran Akın, Ervin Nur Doğuş, Hafize Hilal Kaya and Pınar Katkat helped us to translate the resources in our public webpage.
- [Emirhan Kurtuluş](https://github.com/emirhan422) translated all resources of Intelligent Interfaces Module and designed the Time Mapper activity.

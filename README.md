# Explorable AI

Understanding AI becomes an important topic for the education. We curated and created different interactive content to teach AI better.  

- We started with the basics of coding. We use [JOY.js](https://ncase.me/joy/) to introduce coding to students. Further, we create new interactive content with joy.js to create AI algorithms.
- It is important to teach the fundamental differences of human and machine, if we want to replicate the functionality of human into machine. Our computer vision part starts with introducing eye. The content is Turkish translation of [The Eye](https://idyll.pub/post/the-eye-5b169094cce3bece5d95e964/).
- Then we moved to pixels, colors and how we use these different representations in simple computer vision algorithms.

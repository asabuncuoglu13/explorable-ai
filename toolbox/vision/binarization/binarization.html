  <h1>Image Binarization</h1>
  <p>
    Binarization. Yes or No. Black or White. 1 or 0. In a binary world, the options are one or the other. There is no
    other choice.

    As we learn previously, the below image has three color elements: Red, Green and Blue. The average of these three
    values are resulted with a grayscale image.
    This gives a broad idea of light intensity. Based on light intensity, we can decide on binarization threshold.
  </p>
  <p>
    Move the slider to change the binarization threshold. Observe when the yellow turns to white and red turns to white
    pixels.
